/**
 * <p>
 * A Change Broker maintains sets of {@link ChangeObserver observers}. Based on incoming notifications it forwards the
 * notification to the observers based on strategies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two kinds of observers: regular {@link ChangeObserver EMFObservers} and {@link ReadOnlyChangeObserver
 * ReadOnlyEMFObservers}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * EMFObservers may change the EMF model and therefore trigger further notifications. To prevent circular updates
 * between EMFObservers, notifications that arrive while the
 * {@link ChangeObserver#handleNotification(org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notification) handleNotification} method is
 * called, will not be forwarded to non ReadOnlyEMFObservers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ReadOnlyEMFObservers are not allowed to change the EMF model. They will receive all notifications at any time.
