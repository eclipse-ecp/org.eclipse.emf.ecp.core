We use the The Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator
(https://github.com/mbarbero/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform)
to manage our Target Defintion.

* Changes MUST ONLY be applied to the ecp.tpd file.
* After every change, the .target file must be re-generated, use the right click action on TPD "Generate Target Defintion File".
* After every change, you must commit both files (.target and .tpd)
* Target can be set by right clicking the TPD file.
